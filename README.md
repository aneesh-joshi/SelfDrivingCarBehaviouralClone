# Self Driving Car Behavioural Clone

This project attempts to clone how a human might steer a car around a road.
As input, it takes the images captured from cameras mounted on a car and the steering angle taken by the car in a virtual environment built for training.

Once the model is generated, we can test it on the track. It takes in an image for each frame and predicts the steering angle for that frame. That angle is taken and the process continues for each frame.
